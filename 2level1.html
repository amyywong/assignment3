    i want to apologize to all the women
    i have called <span id="pretty"> pretty.</span>
    <br><p>Before i’ve called them intelligent
    or, brave.
    <p>i am sorry i made it sound as though
    something as simple as what you’re born with
    is the most you have to be proud of
    when your spirit has crushed mountains<p/>
    from now on i will say things like,
    <br>you are resilient
    or,

    <br>you are <span id="extraordinary">extraordinary.</span>
      <br><p>not because i don’t think you’re pretty.
    <br>but because you are so much more than that.<p/>
