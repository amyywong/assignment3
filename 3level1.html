<h1 id="rupikaur">rupi kaur: i want to apologize to all the women</h1>
    <div class="container">
<br><p>i want to apologize to all the women<p/>
    <p>i have called pretty.<p/>
    <p>Before i’ve called them intelligent or brave.<p/>

<div class="box">
    <p>i am sorry i made it sound as though<p/>
    <p>something as simple as what you’re born with<p/>
    <p>is the most you have to be proud of<p/>
    <p>when your spirit has crushed mountains<p/>
  </div>
    <p>from now on i will say things like, you are resilient<p/>
    <p>or, you are extraordinary.<p/>
    <p>not because i don’t think you’re pretty.<p/>
    <p>but because you are so much more than that.<p/>
