<div class="content">

    <p>i want to apologize to all the women
i have called pretty.
</div>

<div class="content1">

Before i’ve called them intelligent or brave.<p/>
<p>i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what you’re born with
is the most you have to be proud of
when your spirit has crushed mountains<p/>
</div>


<div class="content2">
  from now on i will say things like, you are resilient
  or, you are extraordinary.

</div>
<div class="content3">

<p>not because i don’t think you’re pretty.
but because you are so much more than that.<p/>
