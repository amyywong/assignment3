<p>i want to apologize to all the women
i have called pretty.<p/>
<ol>
<li>Before i’ve called them intelligent or brave.</li>
<li>i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what you’re born with
is the most you have to be proud of
when your spirit has crushed mountains</li>

<p>from now on i will say things like,<p/>
  <ul>
    <li>you are resilient</li>
<br>or,
<br><li>you are <em>extraordinary</em>.</li>
<br><p>not because i don’t think you’re pretty.
but because you are so much more than that.<p/>
