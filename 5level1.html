<div class="apologize">

i want to apologize to all the <span id="women">women</span>
i have called <span id="women">pretty.</span>

<br>Before i’ve called them intelligent or brave.
</div>

<div class="sorry">

<br>i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what you’re born with
is the most you have to be proud of
when your spirit has crushed mountains
</div>

<div class="like">

<br>from now on i will say things like, you are resilient
or, you are extraordinary.
<br>not because i don’t think you’re pretty.
<br>but because you are so much more than that.
