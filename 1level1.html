    <p>i want to apologize to all the women<p/>
   i have called <span id="pretty">pretty</span>
   <p>Before i’ve called them intelligent or brave.<p/>
    <br><p>i am sorry i made it sound as though<p/>
    <p>something as simple as what you’re born with<p/>
    <p>is the most you have to be proud of<p/>
    <p>when your spirit has crushed mountains<p/>
    <br><p>from now on i will say things like, you are resilient<p/>
    <p>or, you are extraordinary.<p/>
  not because i don’t think you’re pretty.
  but because you are so much more than that.
